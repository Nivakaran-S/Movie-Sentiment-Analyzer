# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Sentiment Analyzer

A web-based sentiment analysis app built with **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow**, capable of predicting whether a movie review is **positive** or **negative**.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project uses a neural network trained on the **IMDB Movie Review Dataset** to analyze the sentiment of user-inputted movie reviews.

The model was built using:
- TensorFlowâ€™s `Embedding` layer for learning word representations
- A **Simple RNN** layer for sequential processing
- Dense layers for classification

---

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- **Embedding Layer** â€“ Converts words into dense vectors. *(This is a trainable embedding layer in TensorFlow.)*
- **SimpleRNN Layer** â€“ Processes the sequences and learns temporal patterns.
- **Dense Output Layer** â€“ Classifies the review as Positive or Negative using a sigmoid activation.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

- IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset
- Contains 50,000 reviews labeled as either **positive** or **negative**
- Preprocessed into padded sequences of integers (word indices)
